To handle the scenario where subprocesses with the same sequence can run in parallel, we need to extend the threading logic to operate at both the subprocess and task levels. Here's an updated version of the script that allows subprocesses with the same sequence to run concurrently.

### Updated Python Script:

```python
import pyodbc
import threading

# Function to connect to the SQL Server
def connect_to_db(server, database, username, password):
    conn = pyodbc.connect(
        'DRIVER={SQL Server};'
        f'SERVER={server};'
        f'DATABASE={database};'
        f'UID={username};'
        f'PWD={password};'
    )
    return conn

# Function to process tasks
def process_task(task_id):
    print(f"Processing Task ID: {task_id}")
    # You can add your actual task processing logic here

# Function to fetch data from the tables
def fetch_data(conn):
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Query to fetch process, subprocess and task data
    query = """
    SELECT p.process_id, p.process_name, sp.subprocess_id, sp.sequence as subprocess_sequence, 
           t.task_id, t.sequence as task_sequence
    FROM process p
    JOIN subprocess sp ON p.process_id = sp.process_id
    JOIN tasks t ON sp.subprocess_id = t.subprocess_id
    ORDER BY p.process_id, sp.sequence, t.sequence
    """
    
    cursor.execute(query)
    return cursor.fetchall()

# Function to process a single subprocess (its tasks)
def process_subprocess(subprocess_tasks):
    current_sequence = subprocess_tasks[0]['task_sequence']
    parallel_tasks = []

    for task in subprocess_tasks:
        if task['task_sequence'] == current_sequence:
            parallel_tasks.append(task)
        else:
            # Run the previous parallel tasks in threads
            run_parallel_tasks(parallel_tasks)
            current_sequence = task['task_sequence']
            parallel_tasks = [task]

    # Run any remaining parallel tasks
    if parallel_tasks:
        run_parallel_tasks(parallel_tasks)

# Function to run tasks in parallel
def run_parallel_tasks(tasks):
    threads = []
    for task in tasks:
        t = threading.Thread(target=process_task, args=(task['task_id'],))
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()
    
    for t in threads:
        t.join()  # Ensure all tasks in the same sequence are completed

# Function to process subprocesses in parallel by sequence
def process_subprocesses_in_parallel(subprocesses):
    threads = []
    
    for subprocess in subprocesses:
        t = threading.Thread(target=process_subprocess, args=(subprocess,))
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()
    
    for t in threads:
        t.join()  # Wait for all subprocesses with the same sequence to finish

# Main function to process all tasks and subprocesses
def process_all_tasks(conn):
    data = fetch_data(conn)
    
    current_process = None
    current_subprocess_sequence = None
    subprocesses_by_sequence = []
    subprocess_tasks = []

    for row in data:
        process_id = row.process_id
        subprocess_id = row.subprocess_id
        subprocess_sequence = row.subprocess_sequence
        
        task_info = {
            'task_id': row.task_id,
            'task_sequence': row.task_sequence
        }
        
        if subprocess_sequence != current_subprocess_sequence:
            if subprocess_tasks:
                # Group all subprocesses with the same sequence and process them in parallel
                subprocesses_by_sequence.append(subprocess_tasks)
            subprocess_tasks = [task_info]
            current_subprocess_sequence = subprocess_sequence
        else:
            subprocess_tasks.append(task_info)
    
    # Process remaining subprocesses
    if subprocess_tasks:
        subprocesses_by_sequence.append(subprocess_tasks)
    
    # Now process subprocesses by sequence
    for subprocess_group in subprocesses_by_sequence:
        process_subprocesses_in_parallel(subprocess_group)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # DB connection parameters
    server = 'your_sql_server'
    database = 'your_database'
    username = 'your_username'
    password = 'your_password'
    
    conn = connect_to_db(server, database, username, password)
    process_all_tasks(conn)
    conn.close()
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Handling Subprocesses in Parallel**: 
   - I added the function `process_subprocesses_in_parallel` to run subprocesses in parallel when they have the same sequence.
   - Subprocesses are grouped by their `subprocess_sequence`, and all subprocesses in the same sequence are started concurrently.

2. **Processing Tasks Within Subprocesses**:
   - Tasks within each subprocess are processed in parallel if they share the same `task_sequence`, similar to before.

3. **Flow of Execution**:
   - Subprocesses are grouped by their sequence.
   - When the sequence changes, all subprocesses with the same sequence are run in parallel using threads.
   - Within each subprocess, tasks are run either sequentially or in parallel based on the `task_sequence`.

### Example Flow:
- If two subprocesses have the same `subprocess_sequence`, they will be executed in parallel.
- Within each subprocess, tasks with the same `task_sequence` will also run in parallel.

This design ensures that both subprocesses and tasks can run concurrently where applicable. Let me know if this is the behavior you were aiming for or if there are any other tweaks you'd like to add!
