The initial requirement was to develop a report to capture failed credits within the DAT application for the previous business day. According to the specifications, this report was supposed to be integrated into an existing ROVI file. The report was developed as per the requirements and sent for UAT testing. During UAT, it was discovered that the report rarely captured any records because there were no failed credits in the DAT application. To facilitate UAT, the time span was extended from 1 business day to the past six months, which resulted in the report pulling in a few records. Based on this, Patrick provided UAT signoff, and the report was deployed to production as per the project timelines.

Once in production, it was expected that the report would often contain zero records, given the low incidence of failed credits. However, the integrated file showed no records, causing confusion and leading to the incorrect assumption that the report wasnâ€™t being generated.

After clarifying this to the business team, they requested a separate report, even if it was empty, to avoid further confusion. To meet this request, we provided a Tableau solution that allows them to view and download the report for any given date, regardless of whether records exist.
